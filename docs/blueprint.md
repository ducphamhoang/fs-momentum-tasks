# **App Name**: Momentum Tasks

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user sign-up, login, and logout using Firebase Authentication.
- Task Creation: Create tasks with a title, optional description, due date, start time, and end time; start and end times create a time-blocked meeting.
- Task Management: View, edit, mark complete, and delete tasks.
- AI Task Prioritization: Utilize a generative AI tool to provide suggestions on prioritizing tasks based on deadlines, time estimates, and user-defined importance levels. Prioritization suggestions take into account time-blocking, suggesting the re-scheduling of time-blocked tasks in order to accommodate newly emergent urgent tasks.
- Data Storage: Data for users and tasks is stored in Cloud Firestore.
