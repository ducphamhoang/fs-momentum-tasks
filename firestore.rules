/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Momentum Tasks application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own profile and the tasks associated with their account.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where {userId} is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}: Stores tasks belonging to a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.
 * - Users can only read, create, update, and delete tasks under their own user document.
 * - No user listing is allowed at the top-level `/users` collection, preventing enumeration.
 * - All write operations are validated to ensure data consistency between the path and document's internal user ID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The path `/users/{userId}/tasks/{taskId}` itself provides the necessary authorization context.
 * No additional `get()` calls or data denormalization is needed to validate ownership.
